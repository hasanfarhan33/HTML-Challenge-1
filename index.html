    <p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and is the largest of the terrestial planets. Unlike the other planets of the solar system that are named after classic deities the Earth's name comes from the Anglo-Saxon word erda which means ground or soil. The earth was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
